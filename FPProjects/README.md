# FPProjects
Both of my Foundations of Programming course projects

## Project objective

Both of these simple projects are developed in relation to the Hello Quantum game developed by IBM. The first project describes the game whereas the second one allows for the user to play an actual game of Hello Quantum.

### Executing the program

Simply run the program as you would with any regular python script and enjoy! Keep in mind you have a maximum number of turns to achieve the desired board.

`python3 Proj2.py`
